# Colour contrast

We must always meet the WCAG 2.0 AAA standard for colour contrast.

The standard requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.

Large text is consider 24px or larger (18.66px or larger for bold text).

You can test a combination of background and foreground colours using the [WebAIM colour contrast
checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
