# Screen readers

Screen readers provide an audio representation of a website. They enable people with a vision impairment to navigate and
perceive the meaningful content of the website.

We must ensure that all our content is navigable and represented in a meaningful way using a screen reader.

Although we don't maintain a list of screen readers we support, the best screen readers to test with are:

- [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1131.html) (OSX)
- [NVDA](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/nvda-keyboard-shortcuts) (Windows)

Please test your work using at least one of these combinations:

- OSX + Safari + VoiceOver
- OSX + Chrome + VoiceOver
- Windows + Firefox + NVDA
